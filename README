Sharp Robots is a game based on computer programming and is
loosely based upon CROBOTS by Tom Poindexter.

Unlike arcade type games which require human inputs controlling
some object, all strategy in Sharp Robots must be complete before the
actual game begins.  Game strategy is condensed into a .NET language
program that you design and write.  Currently only CSharp is supported.
Your program controls a robot whose mission is to seek out, track, and 
destroy other robots, each running different programs.  Each robot is 
equally equipped, and up to four robots may compete at once.
Sharp Robots is best played among several people, each refining their 
own robot program, then matching program against program.
